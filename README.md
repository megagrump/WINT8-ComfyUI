# WINT8 Nodes

**This is a fork for my own personal use. Useless shit from the original has been removed**

A self-contained suite for working with INT8 quantized diffusion models. No dependency on int88 or any other external custom node — all quantization logic is built in.

## WINT8 Diffuser Loader

Loads INT8 quantized diffusion models with full control over the quantization pipeline.

### Features:

* Tensorwise mode — one scale per weight tensor. Fast loading, minimal memory overhead
* Blockwise mode — one scale per 128×128 tile. Finer quantization granularity, better quality for models with activation outliers
* Sage Attention — optional replacement of ComfyUI's attention kernel with Sage Attention for reduced VRAM usage (requires sageattn package)
* QuaRot — optional Hadamard rotation to spread outliers before quantization, improving INT8 quality
* On-the-fly quantization — quantize fp16/bf16 checkpoints to INT8 at load time (for non-pre-quantized models)
* Model type presets — dedicated exclusion lists for flux2, z-image, chroma, wan, ltx2, qwen, ernie, hidream ensuring the right layers stay in full precision

Supported models: Flux2, Z-Image Turbo, Chroma, WAN, LTX2, Qwen, Ernie, HiDream, and any INT8 pre-quantized diffusion model

## WINT8 Power LoRA Loader

Multi-LoRA loader adapted for INT8 quantized models. Uses a dynamic forward hook instead of the standard ComfyUI weight patching path, so LoRAs apply correctly without needing to dequantize and re-quantize the entire model.

* Same powerful multi-row UI as the Winnougan Power LoRA Loader
* Uses your existing standard LoRA files — no INT8-converted LoRAs needed
* Individual on/off toggles and strength controls per LoRA
* Global toggle all button
* Live LoRA search dialog
* Passes CLIP through unchanged


Requirements
- ComfyUI (latest)
- PyTorch 2.1+
- `triton` (optional, for fused INT8 kernels — Linux native, Windows via `triton-windows`)
- `scipy` (optional, for optimized Hadamard matrices)
- `sageattn` (optional, for Sage Attention in WINT8 Diffuser Loader)
- ComfyUI-GGUF (optional, for GGUF CLIP loading in Winnougan CLIP Loader)
